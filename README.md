## Load an unpacked extension - ([Documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/))

The directory holding the manifest file can be added as an extension in developer mode in its current state. To load an unpacked extension in developer mode, follow these steps:

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to _**chrome://extensions**_
   - Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Extensions menu button and selecting **Manage Extensions** at the bottom of the menu.
   - Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over **More Tools** then selecting **Extensions**
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the extension directory.

Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. Because no icons were included in the manifest, a generic icon will be created for the extension.
